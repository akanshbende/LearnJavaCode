/*
* Garbage Collection is the automatic process of reclaiming memory used by objects that are no longer needed or accessible in the program.

*| Aspect              | Details                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| What it does        | Frees memory by cleaning up unused objects           |
| When it runs        | Automatically, in the background                     |
| Can you control it? | You can suggest with `System.gc()`, but canâ€™t force  |
| Benefit             | Prevents memory leaks and manages memory efficiently |
